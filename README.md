A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Auth_helper is a Singletone class that is responsible for saving and getting the user token and credentials 
From the local storage and to the local storage, we also use it for sending the Bearer toekn in the API interceptor.

Rmote repository is responsible for all the APIs we use through out the application.
I've used retorfit generator with freezed and dio for handling the APIs and remote data.
